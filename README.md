A Vim plugin in the style of Kyle

# Testing Environment

There is a blank vimrc file called testenv.vimrc.  Start vim as follows to create a blank testing environment: ``vim -u testenv.vimrc``

To install the plugin for testing, create a plugin directory in ``~/.vim`` and add the folder ``plugin``.  Then symlink the project directory into this new directory.
